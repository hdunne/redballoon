						The natural life cycle of a honey bee colony is dictated by the seasons. During the
						winter honey bees will remain in their hive and cluster together for warmth. The drones (males)
						will be killed off generally by being kicked out of the hive by the worker bees in order to
						conserve honey. During the first half of winter no eggs will be laid.
					</p>
                    <p>
						The second half of winter is when eggs will begin to be laid again. Remember that drones come from unfertilized eggs
						and so this is when they are replaced. This is also the time where
						consumption of honey is increased to help the bees survive. In general a colony need 50 to 100 lbs of honey
						to survive the winter. Starvation and death by freezing is normal in the winter so do no be alarmed by
						reduced population size during this time.
 	 				</p>
				    <p>
						Once spring comes around the queen will begin laying eggs in earnest to revive the population. Nectar gathering
						will begin again in order to replace the stores of honey that were used over the winter. The middle of spring is
						when workers will begin constructing queen cell's in order to raise new queens.  If the hive is large enough, before
						the next queen is born the current, or parent, queen will lose some weight so she can fly and then take half of the 
						colony with her to start a hive, this is called swarming. If the hive is still too large the first queen born will 
						also take a portion of the colony and leave to find a new home. The rest of the time until winter is spent building 
						the hive and making honey.
