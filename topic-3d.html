						 Honeybees are subject to microbial diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. 
						 The honeybee constantly cleans the hive, removing dead larvae and bees, and seals off bacteria
						 by using propolis.  The two most prolific diseases that will be covered is the American 
						 foulbrood disease (AFD) and  Sacbrood disease.
					</p>
                    <p>
						The worst bacterial disease that affects a bee colony is the American foulbrood disease (AFB); 
                        This disease only affects the bee brood, it is contagious, and can live dormant for up to 50 years or more.  
                        The hive will start to have a few dead larvae or pupae; which will increase and infect other 
                        hives. Treatment will consist of killing the infected hive and bees 
                        with a poisonous gas called sulphur powder.  The dead bees, and all the hive materials and infected 
                        equipment are placed into a hole in the ground and burned with kerosene, and then the hole is 
                        covered with dirt to prevent other bees from stealing any contaminated honey.  
                        
						
 	 				</p>
				    <p>
						Sacbrood disease is a common disease caused by the virus Morator aetotulas.  This virus affects the 
 						larvae and they will fail to mature after four days.  
 						The honeybees hygiene methods will aid the hive in recovering.  Often this virus proliferates when 
 						the hive is under stress due to food shortages, inadequate queen, poor bee hygiene, other diseases, 
 						and adverse climatic conditions.  To treat this virus, it may be necessary to replace the queen, 
 						providing food, and increasing the worker bees. 
						
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 				 Protozoan disease or Nosema disease is caused by the Nosema apis protozoa.  Their spores infect adult bees as 
 	 				 the bee absorbs the protozoa in food, where it proliferates in the gut, causing a disruption of protein metabolism. 
					 Their abdomen will appear shiny and swollen.  The bees most affected will be incapable of flying, 
					 have a reduced life span, and a deterioration of hypopharyngeal glands will ensue.  The queen beeâ€™s capacity 
					 of egg-laying will be reduced.  If the bees cannot fly, the disease will proliferate, and weaken the strength 
					 of the colony.  Only a microscopic inspection can determine if the bees have been attacked by the Nosema apis 
					 protozoa. The treatment could consist of replacing the queen, and removing the affected and weakened bees.  
					 Strong stress-free hives with ample ventilation and climate control can help eliminate the possibility of being
					 attacked by this parasite.  Honeybees and their queens should be purchased from disease-free sources, and hives
					 that may be infected by the Nosema apis protozoa should be treated with heat and fumigation.  Honeycombs should
					 be changed every two years.  An antibiotic, fumagillin, can be used when the hive may experience stress, such as
					 humidity from rain, or winter cold.  Antibiotics must not be administered if it pollutes the honey.  
					</p>
					<p>
					Tracheal Mite:
 					Acarapis woodi, or tracheal mite, is microscophic in size that invades the tracheal area of the adult honeybee, and within a few 
 					days, lays eggs.  After twelve days, the male mites emerge, and 13-16 days later, the females emerge.  These mites
 					decrease the life span of the honeybee, causing a loss of colony strength, and can result in increased loss of bees
 					during the winter.  To accurately diagnosis the infestation, 20 bees that are unable to fly are dissected and 
 					inspected for the mites which can be located in the thorax at the end of the first tracheal pair.  Treatment 
 					consists of ethereal oils and formic acid.
