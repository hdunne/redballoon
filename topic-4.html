					<p>Beekeeping is a unique hobby and can be very profitable, but before beginning, check the local laws to determine if there is any restrictions to beekeeping.  There may be restrictions on the number of hives, or a registration fee may also be required.  Check with the neighbors; there maybe some people who are severely allergic to bees which could be life-threatening.</p>

					
					<p>
						Beekeeping can be a costly hobby to start. It is possible to save some money here and
						there but at the beginning you will be spending a few hundred dollars to begin. 
					</p>
                    <p>
						Starting with the hive, the actual structure in which your bees will live, you have
						a few options.  The least expensive but most difficult option would be to build your own,
						you can find instructions to do this online. For a bit more money you can order a
						kit that you assemble yourself. Or if you are not the craftsman type you can order a 
						pre-built hive.  Hives come in many different materials and depending on the type
						you choose and the aesthetics, you can expect to spend quite a bit. Many beginner beekeepers 
						will start with 2 to 3 hives which understandably will increase costs.
						It's also important to note that as your hive's colony grows you may need to split the 
						colony which could mean keeping additional hives. 
						
 	 				</p>
				    <p>
						Many tools are available to beekeepers and when looking through magazines you can see how
						these costs could start to add up.  Thankfully very few tools are absolutely required and 
						many of them are items you only need one of regardless of the number of hives you keep.
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 					Bee suits can be expensive if you decide on the traditional European suit.  You can cut costs
 	 					by using a painters suit as an alternative.  Bee gloves and a veil are strongly recommended.
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 					Your next big investment are the bees themselves.  It is possible to obtain a free swarm if you
 	 					are willing to provide honeybee removal for someone who has a wild colony they need removed but
 	 					wild colonies are not recommended for beginners.  
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p> 
 	 					You have three options when starting a colony.  The first is to buy an entire hive.  This will include
 	 					an established queen, her brood and her workers, and hive structure itself. You are basically moving their
 	 					entire home to a new location. This is the most established type of colony and
 	 					the easiest to begin with, it is also the most expensive. 
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 					Next you have the option of purchasing a "nuc" or nucleus hive. This is a mini hive and includes
 	 					a queen, brood, and workers.  You take it and place it into your hive. This transition of home will
 	 					require the colony to re-establish itself.
 	 				
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 					Finally you have the option of simply purchasing bees.  This means a queen and 3 pounds of workers that you
 	 					again insert into your hive. Remember that when swarming, queens naturally leave with a portion of the workers
 	 					to begin a new colony so this can be a viable option but is the least established and therefore weakest colony and can be difficult
 	 					to successfully maintain.
