						A bee suit is important for your protection but also for the comfort of your bees. 
						A bee suit is white because bees perceive that color as less of a threat and are
						therefore less disturbed when you approach them in the suit.  While sooner or later
						every beekeeper is going to be stung proper protective clothing will reduce the frequency.
						(A helpful tip from experienced beekeepers in the event you are stung is to use your thumbnail
						to scrap the stinger off rather than attempting to pluck it out with your fingers which will 
						only cause you to squeeze the venom sac and inject more of the venom into yourself resulting in
						more painful stings!)
						It is possible to reduce costs by using a painters suit instead however you will need to
						duct tape the arms and legs to ensure bees are unable to climb inside of your clothing.

                    <p>
						Your most important tool is your smoker.  While they are sold in various sizes it is 
						recommended that you use a larger one as running out of fuel in the middle of inspecting
						your bees can be a problem.  Smoke from the smoker is used to calm the bees while you work.
						You can use many different kinds of fuel in the smoker such as burlap, pine shavings, baling twin,
						or pine needles. 
 	 				</p>
				    <p>
						Additionally it is a good idea to have a hive tool in order to pry open your hive as the
						bees will build their combs onto the top making it difficult to open.  A frame grip is helpful
						in pulling frames up and out of the hive. A bee brush can be used to wipe bees off of a surface
		                such as when trying to close the hive back up so you do not squash them. An entry reducer can be
		                used during the winter or other times when the hive is weak in order to give them less of an opening
		                that they have to defend from invaders. And finally an adrenaline shot can be useful to have on hand
		                in the event of allergic reaction to a sting.
