						Bees like to get to their food source using the shortest route.  Make sure their food source
						wonâ€™t disturb neighbors or pets.  Bees defecate in flight, which could stain cars, sidewalks, 
						or driveways.  Building a fence will cause the bees to fly up and away to their source of nectar,
						and away from people so its a good idea to have some in place.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bees like a comfortable climate, neither too hot or too cold.  The hive should be placed in a
						quiet, isolated area away from low spots subject to flooding.  They should also be placed in
						a pesticide free area where they will not carry the pesticide back to the hive killing the
						other bees.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Bees will need water and food daily.  Make sure that there is plenty for them to eat and 
						drink to keep them healthy.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The amount of time you spend on your bees is really a matter of personal preference. At minimum,
						during months in which the hive is active you should check on them once a month and during
						the winter try to limit it to every 3 months so that you are not letting the cold into their hive.
						More time with the bees means they'll become more used to your presence and you'll be more familiar with
						their behavior and quicker to spot problems but in general your bees know what they are doing and less 
						time with them could mean less stress and less disruption for the hive.
