						Honeybees are important to human life. 
					 	They pollinate crops and produce several items:
					    honey, propolis, royal jelly, wax, and honey.  
					    Approximately 80% of the earth’s food chain is tied to the honeybees’
					    pollination efforts. 
					    Health products and medicines are made from the honeybees’ produce.  
					    Cotton, pollinated by bees, is used for clothing, home furnishings, etc.  
					    Cattle and livestock depend on alfalfa and oats, which are pollinated by
					    honeybees.  Honeybees contribute positively to the economic health of a society.
					    Pollination reduces food- scarcity and increases GDP (gross domestic product).
					</p>
                    <p>
						Honeybees are not native to America, but were brought over by 
						the English in 1622, thus they are rightfully called
						“European honeybees”.  The honeybees’ first home was in Virginia, 
						and then they spread throughout the country.  They are the only
						known insect that produces food.
