						The most common type of hive used in the United States is the Langstroth. Starting from the
						bottom you have the stand which lifts the hive up off the ground, then you have the bottom board 
						upon which the hive rests. 
					</p>
                    <p>
						Your main compartment is known as the Deep Super or the Brood Chamber. This 
			            consists of several frames in which the bees will construct their honeycombs. In here will live your
			            queen, the drones, and the brood (immature bees.) It is possible to start with only the Deep Super and
			            add Honey Supers after your hive begins to grow.  Once you add Honey Supers you may consider adding a
			            Queen Excluder so that the queen is unable to reach the honey supers and make more brood, this will
			            help control the size of the hive and to a degree prevent swarming as well as make honey extraction easier
			            for you when its time to harvest.  Honey Supers will have additional frames for the hive to build in
			            and store honey.
 	 				</p>
				    <p>
						Finally you have your inner cover which has a bee escape that will be used when you want to empty the hive
						for harvesting and then your outer cover which protects	the hive from rain. 
 	 				</p>
 	 				<p>
 	 				Additional kinds of hives include the Top Bar Hive and the Warre Hive. <br/> <br/>
 	 				Top Bar Hives are built to enable the bees to build their own cells and combs depending on
 	 				the sizes and shapes that they would naturally design them.  These hives can be either vertical or
 	 				horizontal. These have the lightest frames to lift, and conform to the natural design of the bee. 
 	 				Very simple to use, and becoming a popular favorite with backyard beekeepers.  High maintenance is
					required. <br/> <br/>
					Warre Hive is a simple and low maintenance hive. It has the same yield of honey as the Langstroth if
					boxes are added in a timely manner.
					</p>
					<p>
					Putting Bees in the Hives: <br/>
					The best time to start a bee hive is in the spring. Bees can be purchased online and will be shipped
					to you.  The bee package weighs about 3 pounds and will include the queen bee, which will be found in
					a separate cage with a few worker bees to attend to her.  A can of sugar syrup may also be included
					for food for the beeâ€™s journey.  The best time to install your bees is in the evening when it is about
					50F to 75F.  Mix 1 part of sugar and 1 part of water and place the mixture in a spray bottle.  Then 
					spray the mixture all over the frames on both sides that will be in the hive, to welcome them into 
					their new hive.  It is important to place the entrance reducer in the opening of the hive to allow the 
					bees to defend the entrance from any robber bees while they are establishing their new colony and helps
					to keep the new bees in their new home.  There is room enough for them to get out and fly around. 
					Bees are very clean insects and they will not eliminate their waste inside the hive, so they will want
					to go to the bathroom outside.  Install the feeder containing 1 part sugar to 1 part water near the 
					entrance of the hive.  Take out the four center frames, as this is where the bees will be placed.  
					Take the bee package and spray all sides of the package with the 1 part sugar to 1 part water mixture. 
					This will help sooth and divert the bees.  Now open the bee package by opening the stapled top panel 
					with the hive tool.  Remove the container of sugar and the cage containing the queen, and place her 
					safely to the side.  Spray the bees again to divert them. Tip the package into the space where the 
					four frames were, and shake the bees into the area since the hive is sprayed with the sugar water,
					the bees will be attracted to their new home.  Next, place the queen in the center of the hive.  
					The queen cage should contain a plug with a piece of sugar at one end.  Only remove the cork where 
					the sugar candy is, leaving the sugar candy in place. The bees will eat the candy from the other side,
					 allowing them to get acquainted with the new queen, and accepting her into the hive.  
					Now, place all the frames into the hive, which will close it up.  Place the bee package next to the 
					hive, the few straggling bees left, will soon make their way into the hive in two to three days.  
					The next step is maintaining the hive.
					</p>
					<p>
					Hive Maintenance: <br/>
					It is important to check the hive at least once a month to determine the health of the hive.  
					Check for diseases and the activity of the bees.  In the fall, harvest the honey.  Make sure that
					there is enough food for the bees in the winter; make a one part sugar to one part water solution,
					place it in a jar with a lid and a small hole, to allow the bees to access the food, but to keep
					out other animals and bugs.  Provide water as well.  Pollen patties provides bees with the
					vitamins, minerals, and protein that they need to keep healthy and strong.
					</p>
					<p>
					Prevent swarming:  <br/>
                    Swarming occurs because the bees are overcrowded, poor ventilation, inadequate water supply, 
                    and queen swarm cells.  Make sure the hive is checked at least every 10 days for queen swarm cells,
                    and remove them.  Even if one remains, it will provide an opportunity for the bees to swarm and 
                    look for a new home.  If there are 50 percent less bees in the hive, or the larvae is old, 
                    it is certain the bees have swarmed.  Swarming bees are unhealthy for the hive as there are 
                    less bees to produce honey and they will not have enough food to make it through the winter months.
